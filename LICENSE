SceneJS-Boilerplate is hereby released into the public domain. You may use it
in any way that you please. Once you create your own project, replace this file
with your own LICENSE file and remove the licenses/ directory entirely.

Please note, if for some strange reason (different laws for example) you wish
to use SceneJS-Boilerplate under different terms you may also use any of the
licenses provided in the licenses/ directory. Currently a GPL v2.0 and a MIT
license is provided.

Also note that SceneJS and JQuery, both of which are used in this project, each
have their own licensing terms. SceneJS-Ext, on the other hand, has similar
licensing terms to SceneJS-Boilerplate and is also released into the public
domain.
